# Dana Thacker (thackerdana)

In the most recent commit she added 3 files: `hw1.Rmd`, `hw1.html`, and
`DataArchitect2.png`

The commit ID is fcacde1b8fb8fcdb26ddf1ee0f69319badf1d8f0

I had no issues kniting the file, but the html output had changes from the one
that was already in the repo. I think is because we used different versions
of Rstudio.

I had no issues with git. It worked well for this lab.
